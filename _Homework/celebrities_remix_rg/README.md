# Deep Learning Defines Famous Names

An ebook of dictionary definitions, generated from famous names using an LSTM neural network ([Char-RNN](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn) by Andrej Karpathy) that I trained on the Oxford English Dictionary.

The included ebook file (Deep_Learning_Defines_Famous_Names.epub) is a sample of the final output, which is still generating and will include all 11,341 names in the pantheon.tsv data set.
