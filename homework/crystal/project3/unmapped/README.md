A map of cell towers in the US spanning from west to east.

The data set doesn't have information I would really like to see, like broadcast strength or popularity, etc. I used the longitude position and colored the towers of the three major carriers -- Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint.

I doubt the data set is even close to complete. For example, there are two Kings counties in the US -- one in California and the other is Brooklyn. The spike on the left shows several towers in the CA county, but the one on the right shows only one tower in all of Brooklyn.
