For this project, I wanted to illustrate narrative arcs. They're usually based on major plot points on conflict and resolution, but I was curious if you could also accurately map the narrative using other features. I tested it out with line length in Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther, with longer sentences being lower, less dramatic periods and shorter lines being higher and more action-filled.
